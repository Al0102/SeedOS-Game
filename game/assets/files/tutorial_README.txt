Hi there!
In this directory, you'll find a file called "aphid_tutorial.sprout".
"dot sprout" files contain a program's data and its executable binary, which
can be run with the command "do <file>".

Some files use your APHID to run.
For these, use Arrow Keys to move your APHID around.

During these processes, you can roam around freely,
HOWEVER, you'll only be able to make a few moves before the next CPU cycle.
After that, the environment will run, be careful where you end your turn!

P - You
* - Corruption
@ - MacroCorruption
# - Wall
. - Floor
n - Nectar (heal)
G - Goal Point

Increase your APHID's speed and gain new actions by finding
upgrade drivers scattered throughout your filesystem.

`do aphid_tutorial.sprout`
