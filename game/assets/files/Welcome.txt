## Welcome to SeedOS! ##

Seed is a revolutionary new system that gets you closer than ever to the metal, literally!

Your Asynchronous, Portable, Human In Device unit takes advantage
of unused neural links to connect your mind directly to the machine.
Think of it like using your subconscious thoughts as extra threads,
allowing you to use the device while maintaining your conscious awareness.

With APHID technology, you can get right into the bits and bytes of a file,
giving you the best control, while keeping the process as intuitive as building with LEGOs.

However, exciting as this all sounds though,
you are one of our valued early testers (Beta Fish Program).
While you get the first look at everything,
precautions must be taken for your safety while we polish things up.

Don’t worry though, this is all temporary while we get things rock solid.
We’ll send in a package to unlock everything for you shortly.

After all, with SeedOS you can
__**Grow the system. Your Way**__
